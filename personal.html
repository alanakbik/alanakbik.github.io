<h3>Backpacking</h3>

            <div class="col-md-4">
  		<p> I love backpacking around the world. After completing my dissertation in the spring of 2015, I spent the rest of the year crossing a large
		part of Asia by <b>land route</b> (that is, only by train, bus, boat, car, and by motorbike - but no flights).

<h4>The Route</h4> 

This trip took me across Russia with the transiberian railway, into the Gobi desert of Mongolia, all across China, into the mountains of Tibet and finally to south east Asia, i.e. 
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Singapore. Check out the map above for a rough indication of my route!

I may put some photos online at some point :) 

<!--
<h4>Russia</h4>

I started by trip in the great city of St. Petersburg in the time of the White Nights 
and slowly made my way through Russia by train, bus and car. In European Russia, Veliki Novgorod and the Golden Ring villages were definite highlights. In Asian Russia, highlights included
crossing Siberia with the transsiberian railway, celebrating <i>dien goroda</i> in Novosibirsk, swimming in Lake Baikal (the deepest lake in the world). And, of course, the vodka :)

<h4>Mongolia</h4>

Using the trans-mongolian railway, I crossed into Mongolia from Ulan Ude. Together with some other backpackers I met in Ulan Bataar we did a tour of the Gobi desert, sleeping in yurts 
(called <i>ger</i> in Mongolia), celebrating the festival of <i>Nadaam</i> in a village and hiking across fields and sand dunes.  

<h4>China</h4>

After the emptiness of Siberia and Mongolia, China was a definite change in pace, with millions of people everywhere in busy Beijing. Of the entire trip, China was 
the most difficult to backpack though (language barrier) but at the same time the most impressive country to see. Highlights included hiking a long portion of the Chinese Wall, 
seeing the Terracotta Warriors, the street markets, making my way from town to town and discovering great food everywhere. 


<h4>Tibet</h4>

From Chengdu, I went into the historical region of Tibet that is part of the very west of Sechuan province, as well as the north west of Yunnan provice. I spent several 
weeks hiking the mountains there and loved every instant. If you like hiking and the mountains, you should really visit there.

<h4>Vietnam, Laos and Thailand</h4>

After many months of travelling in Russia and China, I reached south-east Asia and spent some time in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand each. I focused mostly on Laos since it is not as 
touristy as Vietnam and Thailand. Vietnam highlights were Halong Bay and Sapa, in Thailand Ko Tao and in Laos pretty much everything. I really recommend renting a scooter for a while
and seeing the country by motorbike.


<h4>Singapore</h4>

Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Southeast_Asian_haze">2015 Southeast Asian haze</a>, I skipped Malaysia and went directly to Singapore. I spent a few days seeing 
all the attractions (there are many) including the Singapore Zoo and the Sky Garden. Then, after over 5 months of travelling, I flew back home to Berlin.
