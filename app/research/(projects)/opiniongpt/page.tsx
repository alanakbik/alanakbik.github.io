            <P>
                What happens if you tune a language model (LM) only on texts written by politically left-leaning persons?
            </P>
            <P>
                Or only on texts written by right-leaning persons? Only on texts by men, or only on texts by women? Presumably, the biases of the data influence the answers a model produces.
            </P>
            <P>
                With OpinionGPT, we separately tuned 11 different models, each only on text written
                by a specific demographic group (men, women, Germans, Americans, left-leaning, right-leaning, etc.).
                This allows us to compare the answers differently biased models give to any question.
            </P>

            <P>
                We seperately tuned the model on texts written only by persons of each respective bias. In this demo, you can ask questions to our very biased model to get very biased answers!
