            <P>
                The classic CoNLL-03 dataset is arguably the most commonly-used dataset to evaluate named entity
                recognition (NER) approaches. However, prior works found that many labels in this dataset are in fact
                not correct. This makes it impossible to use CoNLL-03 to fairly evaluate NER models.
            </P>
            <P>
                With CleanCoNLL, we present a significantly improved version of CoNLL-03. We semi-automatically corrected
                over 7% of all NER labels in CoNLL-03. The resulting dataset is nearly noise-free.
