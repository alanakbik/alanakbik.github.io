            <H2>Tagging Text with Flair</H2>
            <P>
                Flair implements state-of-the-art approaches for various NLP tasks such as:
                <OL>
                    <li>sentiment analysis</li>
                    <li>named entity recognition (NER)</li>
                    <li>part-of-speech tagging (PoS)</li>
                    <li>entity linking</li>
                    <li>... and many others!</li>
                </OL>
                With a few lines of code, you can load one of our pre-trained models and apply it to your text!
            </P>

            <P>
                For instance, our 18-class entity tagger can detect entities such as person names, dates, organizations,
                place names, and many others:
            </P>
            <BlockImage src="/flair-ontonotes.png" alt="Text tagged with our 18-class entity tagger"/>
            <P>
                Flair supports tagging of text in many languages. In fact, many models are multilingual, allowing you
                to input text in any language.
            </P>
            <H2>Biomedical Models</H2>
            <P>
                Flair also includes the HunFlair family of models that allow you to tag and link biomedical text data.
                This allows you to detect the names of genes, diseases, chemicals and link them to
                normalized identifiers in a knowledge base:
            </P>
            <BlockImage src="/hunflair.png" alt="Text tagged with our biomedical entity tagger" maxWidth={80}/>
            <P>
                For instance, in the above example, &quot;autism&quot; is detected as a disease name and linked to the term
                &quot;Autism Disorder&quot; in a standardized knowledge base. &quot;Mice&quot; is detected a a species name and linked to
                the entry &quot;Mus Musculus&quot;.
            </P>

            <P>
                Our tutorials explain how to apply NLP models to your data, and even how to train your own models.
                Since Flair was designed to be simple to use, the tutorials should be quick to complete.
            </P>
